# COVID-19-Mask-Recycling
This repository contains all the information and designs for prototyping sterilization box for recycling face masks.

Face masks are a neccesity in this health crisis that is communicable and spreads mostly by inhaling the virus cells in the air. This project is to address the much needed effort in recycling these masks as they pose a serious threat of scarcity as well as to thier negative impact on the environment.

We are looking at different options that have proven to be relatively effective as of now. Our main consideration is also to come up with something that is easy to use and impact huge masses all over the world.
